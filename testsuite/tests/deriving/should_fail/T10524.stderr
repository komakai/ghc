T10524.hs:7:58: error:
    No instance for (Typeable (WrappedFunctor f a))
      arising from the 'deriving' clause of a data type declaration
      GHC can't yet do polykinded Typeable (WrappedFunctor f a :: *)
    Possible fix:
      use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
        so you can specify the instance context yourself
    When deriving the instance for (Data (WrappedFunctor f a))
